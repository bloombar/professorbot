# Code

* Our style guide is based on [Google's](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html), most of it is automaticaly enforced (and can be automatically applied with `npm run autofix`)
* Commits should follow the [Angular commit message guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines). This is because our release tool uses this format for determining release versions and generating changelogs. To make this easier, we recommend using the [Commitizen CLI](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) with the `cz-conventional-changelog` adapter.
